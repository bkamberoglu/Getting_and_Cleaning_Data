Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

This is a project for Getting and Cleaning Data course


Download the source from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

and unzip into a local folder such as /Users/username/r_programming_coursera/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/UCI_HAR_Dataset

Save your run_analysis.R into /Users/username/r_programming_coursera/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

Either you can set RStudio.setwd to /Users/username/r_programming_coursera/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/ 

or when you run the run_analysis.R, you give the exact path. (I didn't change the RStudio.setwd)

then source("./r_programming_coursera/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/run_analysis.R")

When run_analysis.R script is run successfully, "each_activity_and_subject_averages.txt" and 

"tidy.txt" files will be created under /Users/username/r_programming_coursera/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
